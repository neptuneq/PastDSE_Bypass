> # **PastDSE EAC Bypass for Rec Room**
This is a patched EAC Bypass made for Rec Room by Rockpikmim888, used JAN - JUN 2022. I'm making this to archive the bypass before it gets lost. Credit to https://github.com/utoni/PastDSE for the DSE bypass.

> **Instructions:**
Make sure windows defender is off before extracting. Load on a usb to prevent BSOD.

*Disclaimer: You must be on either Windows version and OS Build in order to use this bypass. It will not work if you are not in either version and OS Build.
Windows 10: Version 20H2 OS Build 19042.508 (make and download here: https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php). If you are not on either verison, a quick Google search will help you find their ISOs or you can vist https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php and make your own. If you're having issues turn off real time protection in windows defender and turn off your anti virus.*

- 1 ) Open loadDriver.exe
- 2 ) Open notepad++.exe, this is the undetected Cheat Engine
- 3 ) Drag the driver DevsAreDogShit.sys into Driver_Map.exe
- 4 ) Open up RecRoom
- 5 ) When the game fully loads, open HandlerOn.exe, This will make your Cheat Engine (notepad++.exe) be able to scan/modify things in Rec Room
	*If is says ??? instead of RecRoom.exe, make sure your windows defender is disabled and re-extract EAC Bypass.*
	*Close Rec Room and redo all the previous steps, if it still says ??? then restart your pc and turn off windows defender then re-extract.*
  
*(Steps 6 and 7 can be skipped if you do Ctrl+Alt+L)*

- 6 ) Click the Table tab in notepad++.exe
- 7 ) Click on Cheat Table Lua Script
- 8 ) Copy everything inside CE-Script.txt and paste it into the Cheat Table Lua Script box
- 9 ) Click on Execute Script
- 10 ) Run Anti-BSOD.bat as admin. This will attempt to prevent BSOD.

Note: If you decide to close the game, you will get an error called "Game Security Violation" This is normal. You will notice that you can not play the game again.
Here is the fix:

- 1 ) Close Steam in the Task Manager. Close RecRoom in Task Manager as well if for some reason it refuses to close
- 2 ) Run HandlerOff.exe make sure it closes on its own
- 3 ) Repeat all the steps
